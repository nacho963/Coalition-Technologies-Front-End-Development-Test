Coalition Technologies - Desktop Front End Development Test Application

This was a skills test for the position Front End Developer. I was given a .psd file and asked to make a pixel-perfect website.

This submission is the result of my skill test for the Front End Developer position at Coalition Technologies. 
The objective of this assessment is to evaluate my capability to transform an Adobe Photoshop file(.psd) into a static, single-page web application. 

The primary goal is to convert the provided PSD into a dynamic desktop single-page website.
